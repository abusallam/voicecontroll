# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the working Voxtral Voice Platform to improve stability, fix the tray stopping issue, add global hotkey support, and implement additional quality-of-life improvements. The platform currently works well for voice transcription and cursor typing but has stability issues and lacks some advanced features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Tray Application Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice platform tray to run continuously without crashing, so that I can rely on it for extended voice input sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the tray application THEN it SHALL run for hours without crashing
2. WHEN processing continuous audio THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN Whisper transcription errors occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully
4. WHEN GTK events cause issues THEN the application SHALL handle them without crashing
5. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them and continue running

### Requirement 2: Improve Audio Processing Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable audio processing that handles various audio conditions, so that voice recognition works consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is too short THEN the system SHALL skip processing without errors
2. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback
3. WHEN microphone input varies THEN the system SHALL adapt automatically
4. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL filter it appropriately
5. WHEN audio buffer overflows THEN the system SHALL recover without crashing

### Requirement 3: Global Hotkey Activation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to activate voice recording with a global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt), so that I can quickly start voice input without interacting with the tray.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Ctrl+Alt THEN voice recording SHALL start immediately
2. WHEN I press Ctrl+Alt while recording THEN recording SHALL stop
3. WHEN hotkey is pressed THEN it SHALL work regardless of active application
4. WHEN hotkey conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL detect and warn about them
5. WHEN hotkey registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily configure voice settings, hotkeys, and transcription options, so that I can customize the system to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to change Whisper model THEN I SHALL have options (tiny, base, small, medium)
2. WHEN I configure hotkeys THEN the settings SHALL be saved and persist
3. WHEN I adjust voice sensitivity THEN changes SHALL take effect immediately
4. WHEN I modify typing behavior THEN I SHALL see the changes in real-time
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Memory and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use memory efficiently and perform well, so that it can run on various hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio continuously THEN memory usage SHALL not increase over time
2. WHEN Whisper model is loaded THEN it SHALL be reused efficiently
3. WHEN audio buffers are created THEN they SHALL be cleaned up properly
4. WHEN transcription completes THEN temporary files SHALL be removed
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the application SHALL degrade gracefully

### Requirement 6: Advanced Voice Activity Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved voice detection that reduces false positives and better handles different speaking patterns, so that transcription is more accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak quietly THEN the system SHALL still detect my voice
2. WHEN background noise occurs THEN it SHALL not trigger false recordings
3. WHEN I pause mid-sentence THEN the system SHALL wait appropriately
4. WHEN I speak rapidly THEN all words SHALL be captured
5. WHEN multiple people speak THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully

### Requirement 7: Error Recovery and Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail
2. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery
3. WHEN recovery fails THEN the system SHALL restart components gracefully
4. WHEN logs become large THEN they SHALL be rotated automatically
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN verbose logging SHALL be available

### Requirement 8: User Interface Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want better visual feedback and control options in the tray interface, so that I can monitor and control the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice recording is active THEN the tray icon SHALL show visual indication
2. WHEN transcription is processing THEN I SHALL see progress feedback
3. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL receive clear notifications
4. WHEN system status changes THEN the tray menu SHALL update accordingly
5. WHEN I need help THEN tooltips and help text SHALL be available
