# Contributing to Voxtral Agentic Voice Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Voxtral Agentic Voice Platform! This project is a community-driven effort to create the best open-source voice assistant for Linux.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features
- Provide detailed information about your system (OS, desktop environment, hardware)
- Include logs and error messages when reporting bugs
- Test with the latest version before reporting

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voxtral-agentic-voice-platform.git
   cd voxtral-agentic-voice-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install UV package manager
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Install project dependencies
   ./scripts/install_uv.sh
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   uv run scripts/test_system.py
   uv run scripts/test_cursor_typing.py
   ```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting: `uv run black .`
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep line length to 100 characters

### Testing

- Test on multiple Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- Test on both Wayland and X11
- Test with different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Test with both GPU and CPU-only systems
- Add unit tests for new functionality

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
2. Make your changes and test thoroughly
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
6. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots/videos if UI changes
   - Reference to related issues

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Multi-language support** - Add support for languages other than English
- **Custom wake words** - Implement trainable wake word detection
- **Voice synthesis** - Add text-to-speech responses
- **Performance optimization** - Reduce memory usage and latency
- **Better Wayland integration** - Improve cursor typing on different compositors

### Medium Priority
- **Additional tools** - File management, calendar integration, email
- **Plugin system** - Allow third-party extensions
- **Configuration GUI** - Visual configuration editor
- **Voice training** - User-specific voice model fine-tuning
- **Context awareness** - Better understanding of user intent

### Low Priority
- **Mobile support** - Android/iOS companion apps
- **Cloud sync** - Optional cloud backup of settings
- **Voice analytics** - Usage statistics and insights
- **Multi-user support** - Different profiles for different users

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
- `agent/` - Core voice processing and AI logic
- `tools/` - Individual tool implementations
- `langraph/` - Workflow orchestration
- `models/` - AI model interfaces
- `config/` - Configuration management
- `scripts/` - Installation and utility scripts

### Adding New Tools
1. Create tool in `tools/` directory
2. Use `@tool` decorator from LangChain
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Update tool registry in `langraph/workflows.py`
5. Add tests and documentation

### Adding New Models
1. Create handler in `models/` directory
2. Implement standard interface
3. Add fallback mechanisms
4. Test with different hardware configurations
